# Memory Processing System Architecture

## Overview
This system is designed to handle media data ingestion, processing, storage, and retrieval using AWS and search technologies. It provides a scalable backend capable of storing and analyzing both raw media and structured metadata.

---

## Architecture Components

### 1. User/Client
- End users or client applications that interact with the system.
- Uploads media and metadata to the backend via APIs.

### 2. Backend/Application Layer
- Acts as the main entry point for the system.
- Handles client requests and routes them to appropriate services.
- Responsible for authentication, validation, and API management.

### 3. S3 Bucket for Media Storage
- Stores raw media files such as images, videos, and documents.
- Provides scalable and cost-effective object storage.
- Triggers events (via S3 events + Lambda) to start processing pipelines.

### 4. Memory Pre-processor Layer
- Processes ingested media or text data before indexing.
- Can include:
  - Text extraction (OCR, NLP).
  - Feature extraction for search.
  - Data normalization and transformation.
- Prepares content for indexing into Elasticsearch or storing metadata in RDBMS.

### 5. RDBMS for Storing Metadata
- Stores structured metadata related to media (e.g., file info, tags, user details).
- Enables fast relational queries and supports system integrity.
- Can be implemented with Amazon RDS (MySQL/Postgres).

### 6. Elasticsearch
- Stores processed media/text data for full-text search and analysis.
- Provides fast indexing and querying capabilities.
- Useful for search-heavy use cases like semantic retrieval or keyword-based lookup.

### 7. AWS Bedrock
- Provides AI/LLM integration for advanced use cases such as:
  - Semantic search.
  - Summarization.
  - Conversational retrieval.
- Works on top of pre-processed data and metadata for intelligent responses.

## Data Flow

1. **User/Client → Backend Layer**
   - Upload media and metadata.
   
2. **Backend Layer → S3 Bucket**
   - Media stored in S3 for persistence.

3. **Backend Layer → RDBMS**
   - Metadata stored in structured format.

4. **Backend Layer → Memory Pre-processor**
   - Extracts features and processes raw data.

5. **Memory Pre-processor → Elasticsearch**
   - Indexed data for fast search queries.

6. **Memory Pre-processor → RDBMS**
   - Metadata refinement and updates.

7. **RDBMS + Pre-processed Data → AWS Bedrock**
   - Bedrock provides semantic and AI-enhanced capabilities.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement event-driven workflows with **AWS Lambda** (triggered by S3 uploads).
- Add monitoring and logging via **CloudWatch**.
- Explore data visualization using **OpenSearch Dashboards** (if needed).
